# FileTree

[English](https://github.com/zhenghaoyang24/filetree/blob/master/README_EN.md  )

## Project Overview

FileTree is a tool based on `Vue3`. You can select a local folder and generate a clear file tree according to its structure.  
The generated file tree can visually display complex folder structures and basic file information, and also allows for file previews. It supports exporting in a file tree format compatible with `Markdown` enhancements, making it convenient to use in `Markdown`.

## Features

- **Folder Selection**: You can select a local folder, and the system will automatically parse its structure.
- **File Tree Generation**: Generate a clear file tree based on the folder structure, supporting expand/collapse operations.
- **Export Functionality**: Export the file tree in a `Markdown`-compatible format, making it easy to use in editors that support `Markdown` enhancements, such as the blog theme [theme-plume](https://theme-plume.vuejs.press/  ).
- **Intuitive Display**: Visually display complex folder hierarchies and basic file information through a tree structure, with file previews.
